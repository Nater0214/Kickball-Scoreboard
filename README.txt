This is a simple (not simple) program that displays a kickball scoreboard, the original being in console, and version 2 being in a gui (I'm still working on this one.)
How to use:

On startup, you will be greeted with a prompt.
p:
    For games that have already started.
f:
    Loads a saved game from a file. (More on this later)
n:
    Starts a new game.
